# Sales Prediction Model

## Overview
This project predicts monthly sales using a linear regression model based on historical sales data. It demonstrates the use of Python, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning techniques.

## Skills & Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn (Linear Regression)
- Matplotlib (Visualization)

## Data Description
The dataset used contains historical sales data for [store/region/category], with the following columns:
- Date: Date of the sale
- Sales: Monthly sales figures
- Category: Product category (if applicable)

## Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Missing values handled, columns formatted, outliers removed.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Trends over time, correlations, seasonal effects.
3. **Model Building**: Applied linear regression to predict future sales.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared values.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of [X%], with the following key findings:
- The sales spike during [holiday/specific season].
- The model predicts future sales with reasonable accuracy, useful for inventory planning.

## Conclusion
This model can be further enhanced by incorporating other factors such as promotions or external market conditions.

## Future Work
- Integrating time-series models like ARIMA.
- Incorporating additional features like holidays or weather data.
